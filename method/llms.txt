audience: humans and llm-based agents

description:
The Inner Loop is a framework for building machines that think.
It focuses on externalizing cognition into small, complete systems
that produce concrete outputs and improve through iteration.

core_method:
- define_output
- design_machine
- build_smallest_version
- persist_state
- ship
- reflect
- repeat

definitions:
machine:
  A machine is any system that:
  - accepts input
  - applies rules
  - persists state
  - produces output
  Code is optional. Structure is required.

output:
  A concrete, testable result produced by a machine.
  Examples include text, decisions, plans, artifacts, or actions.

state:
  Any memory that allows a machine to improve over time.
  Examples include markdown files, json, localstorage, logs, or history.

constraints:
  Deliberate limits on scope, time, or tools.
  Constraints are used to force completion and clarity.

preferred_mediums:
- markdown
- vanilla_html
- vanilla_javascript
- json
- localstorage
- plain_text

optional_engines:
- llms
- prompt-based systems
- agentic workflows

llm_usage_guidelines:
- LLMs may be used as engines, not authorities
- Outputs must be understandable by humans
- Machines should remain inspectable and editable
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction or infrastructure

rules:
- favor small, complete systems over large abstractions
- defer polish until after function
- avoid backend services unless strictly required
- reflection is a required step of the loop

intent:
- teach execution as a repeatable skill
- enable the design of thinking machines
- reduce cognitive load through systems
- support individual, team, and organizational scale

non_goals:
- teaching specific frameworks
- promoting particular vendors or tools
- maximizing engagement or content volume
