project: The Inner Loop
type: execution-framework
description: A framework for building machines that think. Focused on defining constraints, designing systems, persisting state, producing output, and iterating.

intent:
- Teach humans how to externalize thinking into systems
- Enable the design of small, agentic machines
- Favor simplicity, clarity, and execution over complexity

primary_artifacts:
- MANIFESTO.md
- README.md
- index.html

preferred_mediums:
- markdown
- vanilla_html
- vanilla_javascript
- json
- localstorage

rules:
- Prefer small, complete systems over large abstractions
- Avoid unnecessary infrastructure
- Output must be concrete and testable
- Reflection is part of the system

interaction_guidelines:
- Treat text files as source of truth
- Do not assume frameworks or backends
- LLMs may be used as engines, not authorities
- Machines should remain understandable by humans

audience:
- builders
- founders
- operators
- creatives
