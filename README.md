# The Inner Loop

**The Inner Loop is an execution framework for building machines that think.**

We don’t focus on apps, stacks, or trends.  
We focus on turning thought into systems that produce outcomes.

## What This Is

The Inner Loop teaches a repeatable way of working:

- Define a constraint  
- Design a machine  
- Persist state  
- Produce output  
- Reflect  
- Repeat  

A *machine* can be:
- a small program
- a set of Markdown files
- a prompt system
- an agentic workflow
- a hybrid of all of the above

If it runs and produces output, it counts.

## What This Is Not

- Not a course  
- Not a tutorial library  
- Not a framework you install  
- Not content to binge  

Inner Loop is about **execution**, not consumption.

## Tools We Prefer (But Don’t Worship)

We choose boring, durable tools:

- **GitHub** — versioned thinking  
- **VS Code** — one place to work  
- **HTML + Vanilla JS** — universal runtime  
- **LocalStorage / JSON / Markdown** — simple memory  
- **LLMs (optional)** — engines, not crutches  

Tools may change.  
The method does not.

## How Repositories Are Structured

Most repositories in this organization follow a simple pattern:
